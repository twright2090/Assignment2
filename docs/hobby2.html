        My love for reading was reignited from boredom. Two years ago, I was at home with nothing to do and desperate to try something new. <br>
        I had some friends who were into reading at the time and I've asked them to suggest me something that they were currently into. <br>
        I started to read the novel for myself and I would go on to buy and read more books. Now, it seems like I have too many books to read. <br>
        A writer that inspired me to become more invested into reading has to be <a href = "https://dariusforoux.com/reading-list/">Darius Foroux</a>
